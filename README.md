Intro and my way of learning .NET Core 3+

A simple web app build on .NET Core 3.1 showing standard CRUD methods, which enable to have a list of restaurants, with
ability to view more information about them, edit that information and delete if necessarry. Connection to SQL database is
done with Entity framework and migrations and HTTP requests are sent by using javascript Jquery library, no front-end 
framework used here. Most of the styling and layout is done with Bootstrap v4 and some tiny amount of custom CSS, like the
use of CSS grid to layout the list page.
